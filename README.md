Hello,

I made an app that lets you make a list of all of o your favorite pop-ups. My MVP was to be able to have a user sign up, add a pop up, log in, add a pop up, and view the pop ups that have been added by all of the users on one page. Users should also be able to edit a pop up, delete a pop up, and lastly log out of the app. I also added an extra feature to allow the users to log directly to twitter or google plus and tell their friends about their new pop-up discovery with a link to their view of the app. 

I organized all of the pop ups on buttons on the screen. If you click on one of them, you will find more information about that individual app. 

In my user stories, I made a list of what users should be able to do from one screen view to another and separated each story so that it was like a check list that I could add to my to-do list for today. I also made a to-do list for tomorrow so that I could keep all of the thoughts organized one what I wanted to accomplish for the next day.
